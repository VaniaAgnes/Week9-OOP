# Answers to Forum Week 9 (OOP)

1a. A class is similar to a blueprint that outlines the construction of objects while An instantiation of a class means actually creating an object based on that blueprint.

1b. Example of Hierarchy: First is Employee Hierarchy, In the administration program, you can create different types of employees like managers, engineers, and salespeople. Second one is User Hierarchy, by using inheritance, you can create a base class with common features like authentication, and then have separate classes for administrators and regular employees that inherit those common features while adding their own specific details.

1c. Libraries are pre-built code components that administrators can use in their programs. They save time and effort by offering pre-built functionalities. Libraries increase efficiency, allow developers to focus on the most important tasks, and provide community support and updates. In short, libraries make administration program development easier, faster, and more effective.

2a. is in the code :) 

2b. The SalesPerson class's accessor methods (getters) control attribute access. They protect data integrity, provide a standardized method for retrieving attributes, and encourage good programming practices. Accessors improve code readability and maintainability, as well as the ability to make changes in the future without affecting other parts of the program.

2c (i). ![uml diagram](https://github.com/VaniaAgnes/Week9-OOP/assets/114584857/712e79a8-1e45-4d91-86dd-2b41b122f82d)

2c (ii). A future change in the design of the Sales object may cause compatibility issues with existing programs. This would necessitate significant changes and could have an impact on their stability and functionality.

2e. in the code :)

2f. in the code :)

2g. in the code :)

2h. In my opinion, we need to add an instance variable to keep track of the sales, we also need to make a method to ensure we calculate the salary of the person per month in the SalesPerson Class. Lastly we made the Sales class to include a timestamp for each sale. 

2i. There is a polymorphism concept that is implemented in this program. It is Overloading which it's a type of Compile-Time Polymorphism. You can see this implementation on SalesPerson class where you have 2 constructor definition/declaration.
